2. Currency Exchange

This project is a Python script designed to perform currency exchange operations. The script allows users to convert between different currencies by fetching real-time exchange rates from an online API.

Key Features:
	•	Real-time Exchange Rates: The script uses an API to get the latest exchange rates for various currencies.
	•	Currency Conversion: It enables the user to input an amount and convert it into another currency based on the current exchange rates.
	•	User Input: The user can select the currencies and the amount to be exchanged.
	•	Error Handling: The project includes error handling for invalid input and API-related errors.

Technologies Used:
	•	Python
	•	API usage for fetching real-time data (e.g., ExchangeRate-API)
	•	User input and basic error handling

Example Usage:
	•	The user can input an amount in one currency and choose the target currency for conversion. The script will display the converted value based on the latest rates fetched from the API.
